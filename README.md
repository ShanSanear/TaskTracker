## What this is for?
This is meant as a starting point for my idea of a simple JIRA-like tasks tracker, which I could work with and develop in my free time

## Tech stack
Currently aiming at:
* API - fastAPI (Python) as RestAPI
  * Maybe with GraphAPI down the line
* Frontend - TBD, possibilities - Angular, React
* Database - sqlite at the start, PostgreSQL
* Internet facing system - Linode server
* 
* CI/CD
  * Github Actions
  * Automatic deploy on the server
